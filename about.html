    <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHITTI</h1>
    <div class="mattter">
        
        <p># chitti Birthday </p>  
        
        <p>6th Jan 2002</p>
        
        <p>It's chitti's birthday </p>
        <p>enjoy the random cute little pictures of chitti on my website</p>
        
        <p>She is cute in the sense of danger cuteness but does not know she looks like an absolute ghost.</p>
        <p>But I like ghosts, she is a very special ghost.</p>
        
        <p>We met very recently, but in this less time she became my close best friend </p>
        
        <p>She is somewhat mindless and overthinker. I to date don't understand with such little brain how she overthinks.</p>
        
        <p>but she is the reason why an introvert like me is forced to reveal my thoughts and build this website.</p>
        
        <p>She is a great singer but destroys some songs sometimes, but if she sings with concentration it will be nice. </p>
        
        <p>that's it, no words to speak</p>
        
        <p>THANK YOU CHITTI FOR COMNG INTO MY LIFE.I HOPE U NEVER LEAVE ME.</p>
