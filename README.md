# chitti
Birthday   

6th Jan 2002

It's chitti's birthday 
enjoy the random cute little pictures of chitti on my website

She is cute in the sense of danger cuteness but does not know she looks like an absolute ghost.
But I like ghosts, she is a very special ghost.

We met very recently, but in this less time she became my close best friend 

She is somewhat mindless and overthinker. I to date don't understand with such little brain how she overthinks.

but she is the reason why an introvert like me is forced to reveal my thoughts and build this website.

She is a great singer but destroys some songs sometimes, but if she sings with concentration it will be nice. 

that's it, no words to speak

THANK YOU CHITTI FOR COMNG INTO MY LIFE.I HOPE U NEVER LEAVE ME.
